**MCMulator PC v7** is an execution enviroment for [**IGB Binary**](https://github.com/krypciak/IGB-Compiler-L1).  

For architecture explanations, see [**IGB VM**](https://github.com/krypciak/IGB-VM).  

You can write programs for it using the [**IGB L2**](https://github.com/krypciak/IGB-Compiler-L2) programming language.

**DISCLAMER:** Doesn't work from 1.18 to 1.20.2 (See [[MC-255244]](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-255244))  
The bug above was fixed in 1.20.3, but this project was not tested on this version, so it may or may not work.

## Storage

In MCMPCv7, storage is based on <strong>NBT</strong>. There are no bits or bytes, only integers. Integers are stored in jukeboxes.  
Data is accessed by an NBT path: **RecordItem.tag.a**  
The position of the armor stand reading data is calculated with this equation:  
x = cell % storageWidth,&nbsp; z = cell / storageWidth  

#### PES (Program Execution Space) (you may call it ROM)
PES is where instructions are stored.  
It has a fixed size of 251x251 (63001)
#### RAM
It has a fixed size of 251x251 (63001)
